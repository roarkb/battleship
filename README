welcome to command-line battleship!

the first and current phase of this project involves simply playing battleship with your computer enemy AI.
future phases will include the computer AI facing off against itself and an API or wrapper-script that will 
face different AI's against each other.  i encourage you all to contribute your own AI's once i figure out
the API/common terms they all should speak.

usage:
"./battleship" => regular mode
"./battleship debug" => debug mode

notes:
- currently works much better on mac/linux due to the fact that i am using the "clear" system call to add 
dramatic effect to my game
